# Development Setup

## Prone to changes.

* If in Windows, activate WSL2. Mac and Linux looks good. (Most of the Linux dev is based on Debian, Ubuntu)
* Golang.
* Shell Utilities -- JQ, YQ.
* Docker. For dev, we prefer to setup CDB, Cache and possibly Jenkins through Docker Containers.
* Activate KVM on WSL2, and setup QEMU (Windows and Linux). If Mac, if Intel, we'd have to make do with VirtualBox only. If ARM chip, consider UTM, a QEMU wrapper.
* Terraform, Packer, Ansible

More to be added.
